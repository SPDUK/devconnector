# DevConnector

- TODO: Fix comment links when clicking on an avatar
currently links to name of the poster and not the correct profile of the user, in the course it just links to "profile.html"

- Learned from : https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/







- /config/keys_dev.js is required, needing 
```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'mongoURLGoesHere'
  secretOrKey: 'secretOrKeyGoesHere'
};
```
